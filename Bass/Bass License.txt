The BASS library is free for non-money making use... if you are
not charging for the software, then you can use BASS in it for
free (a mention in the credits would be nice though!). If you
wish to use BASS in shareware or commercial products, then see
the next section.

BASS in shareware and commercial software?
==========================================
BASS is available for use in your shareware and commercial software.
The license types available are as follows:

SHAREWARE: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number of your
shareware products.

SINGLE COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in a single commercial
product.

UNLIMITED COMMERCIAL: Allows the usage of BASS in an unlimited number
of your commercial products. This license is on a per site basis. So
if your company has two sites and both use BASS, then two licenses are
required.

In all cases there are no royalties to pay, and you can use all future
BASS updates without further cost. One license covers one person or
entity and is not transferable.

These licenses do not allow reselling of BASS, ie. as part of another
development library. If none of these licenses match your requirements,
or if you have any questions about using BASS in shareware/commercial
software, then please get in touch (email: bass@un4seen.com).
